# Pet Classification Algorithm

This is the capstone project for the non-structured data model for the Data Science and Machine Learning course at [Let's Code Academy](https://letscode.com.br/), created by the student group []().

**Project Status: [Active]**

## Objectives

This project aims to tackle the animal species classification problem using the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/). The main goal is to classify between cats and dogs while the secondary goal is to classify the dog breed present in the dataset.

Baing mainly academic, this project showcases the ability to manipulate non-structred data and the employment of image classification methods.
